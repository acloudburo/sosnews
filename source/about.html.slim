      ## Dear [Plattenhof](http://plattenhof.ch/) and [Townhouse](http://townhouse.ch/) guests

      It is a pleasure to have you with us and we hope you feel at home in our hotels. We also would like you to feel a little bit like a local in Zurich and therefore we try to point out some of our favorite places in our town Zurich. 

      We try to show you hidden caf√©s, fun restaurants, great galleries, hidden places and stores that you will not find in every other city as well. 

      We would love to welcome you at our restaurant <b>Kantorei</b> during your stay. The Kantorei is a lively Brasserie with delicious regional dishes and is located in heart of the old town on Neumarkt one of the most picturesque spot in Zurich. 

      Enjoy our wonderful city.
